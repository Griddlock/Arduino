Well I heard there was a new technique
To make a costume be unique
But you don't use much foam in cosplay, do ya?
Well it goes like this, the patterns down
You trace the edges all around
make beveled cuts, then line them up and glue them

Then you glue 'em
and you glue them
Then you glue 'em
and you glue them

Well your cuts are good, but the template's rough
Your heat gun couldn't curve enough
There is no fix, you had to start a new one
You smooth the sides with a sanding stick
The Kwikseal's on, yes it did the trick
You reinforce the seams with a hot glue gun

with a glue gun
the hot glue gun
with a glue gun
the hot glue gun


The Plastidip went on last night
Your trial fit was still too tight

The clock strikes three, you hear it chime
With one more day, there is barely time
Prioritize which detail you must do now

What to do, now?

You're hard at work, like none before
Supplies and tools strewn on the floor
Straining just to paint on all the detail
And finally your new cosplay
Is ready! Comicon's today!
Congratulate yourself, you made it through yeah!

Made it through yeah
Hallelujah!
Made it through yeah
Hallelujah!

You browse the expo, try to shop
With people getting you to stop
So they can get a photo of your costume
You strike the pose with all your might
You're basking in the camera light
And all amazed, they
