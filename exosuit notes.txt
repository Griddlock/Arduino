button = joystick clicker button
Trigger 0 = top trigger on right hand
Trigger 1 = bottom trigger on right hand
Trigger 2 = top trigger on left hand
Trigger 3 = bottom trigger on left hand
Master = main power switch

Menu modes:
(y)	Safety: button toggles between on/off
(b)	Straps: button toggles between open/close, trigger 1 toggles straps, trigger 2 toggles lock
(r)	Weapons: button toggles rear guns up/down. Triggers: 1-right arm, 2-right rear, 3-left arm, 4-left rear
(w)	Spotlight: button toggles on/off


Standing locks
	- ankle (2)
	- knee (2)
	- hip (2)
	- hip lateral rotator (2)
	- torso (1) (lock the left/right tilting)
	- shoulder (2)
	- elbow (2)
The standing locks must be adjustable during development because the weight distribution will change constantly, maybe even after as well.
	- toothed washer, like the baby-swing switched

Strap locks
	- foot (2)
	- shin (2)
	- thigh (2)
	- shoulder (2)
	- lower arm (2)
To minimize wiring, pairs: (foot + shin) x 2, (both thighs) x 1, (shoulder + arm) x 2
Chest strap held down with magnets (must be strong enough for chest strap to hold weight of entire suit)
Chest strap lifts the entire external chest cover up out of the way (pistons with contracting spring to pull upward)

Gun arm position
	- 'elbow' (2)
	- 'wrist' (2)

Battery packs must ALL be accessible while wearing the suit!
	- arms
	- chest (inner layer)
	- hips

Connect everything with RJ-45 connectors, including the low-amp power supplies.

Hobby battery needed for the arm motors (also better motors) to get the arm to come up fast enough.

	12v battery, but might not have an available charger

Need to have dedicated Arduino to control the two arm joints, since it will need a very fast response; cannot afford to share multitasking, probably?

Each gun has its own Arduino for:
	- lighting effects
	- mp3 player (with a minimum 1-minute long sound effect of the gun)
	- speaker inside the gun, for authentic 3D sound.
Enabled by trigger, but only if the safety is NOT on.
Each gun should have a unique gun sound to differentiate between them.


Materials list
- Steel channel ($15 each, 12')
- J-trim ($6 each, 10')
- ABS sheets? or other kid of plastic that is lighter but durable
- precut locking mechanisms (circles with slit for the lock)
	- Maybe PVC pipes, one inside the other with a hole for the lock (coupler + pipe)
- PVC pipes for the guns
- heavy duty battery for all motors
- something as light as foamcore but stronger, for the shoulder guns (or foamcore + 2mm foam?)
- trigger buttons (4)


Work list

Programming
	- standing locks must be added with the 

Aluminum Frame
	- Foot
		- The sole must be rigid for lock-standing
		- Sides include the ankle joint to the shin
	- Shin
		- Simple rigid piece with the joins on each end
		- Make the height of it adjustable in some small way
		- Back might need a flap that flips down to add stand-alone stability (on locking)
			- the worm gear assembly would work well (fast and locking)
	- Thigh
		- Simple joint at knee
		- Large joint at hip
	- Hip
		- Joint to leg
		- Wrap around torso to join both sides
		- Needs z-axis rotation where hip joint is connected to the torso so legs can change stance (distance from center)
			- should be spring-loaded so that they return to a natural position for standing
			- might still need an aditional lock for that z-axis joint
	- Torso
		- Single joint on the back, needs lock (or spring-loading, preferred)
		- Must adjust slightly with movement (bending forward/back will depend on the hip)
		
	- Chest
		- One piece that flips up/down
		- some sort of lock under the arm to keep it down (clip, motor-lock, magnet preferred)

Standing Locks
	- rectangle pieces of thick metal
		- slot on one side for the lock insert
		- hole for common axis
		- hole on oppisite side of slot for adjusting, recessed head to keep from catching on the opposite piece.

	- dual circles
		- inner and outer circle, this will keep them fitted together, as opposed to a cirlce and a reinforced bolt
		- each attached to an opposite piece, groove for the locking piece
		- locking mechanism attached to the same side as the outer circle
		- bolt is on a stretchable/compressable spring to allow it to snap into the inner circle and pull out of the inner when the friction is released
		- Lego actuator would work in this case.
		- The inner circle would have to be adjustable for the angle

BEST OPTION:
	- wide joints
		- simple reinforced bolt spring loaded to go into the slot on the leg
		- position of the slot would not be movable
		- but it would have a stronger mechanical advantage than a smaller circle.
		- having a balancer come down from the back of the foot/shin would allowe greater margin of error for balance
			- could also allow for removing props and still be able to stand

	- bolt slider
		- lego actuator pushing and pulling a spring attached to the bold
		- bolt should be at least three times as long as its movement
		- strong encasement that can hold the pressure of the torque
