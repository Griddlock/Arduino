Introduction to Arduino
- why use Arduino (cheap, easy, small, versatile)
- what it is (show the board, tiny microcontroller)
- what it can be used for (controlling lights, motors, speakers, anything electric)
	- using them in cosplay enhances your costume dramatically
- digital and analog pins (output high/low, analog read)
- use on a breadboard (for development)


Programming
- how to install the develpment environment
- how to start a new project
- how to connect the arduino board (USB)
- how to select the correct port (before and after plugging in, to help identify port)
- compile (translate into the native language of the board) and upload
	- blank program does nothing, but the environment is ready to work with.


Programming basics
- variables, what they are
- some variable types (int & boolean)
- if blocks (decision making)
- commands to set up serial output (for beginner programming)
- manipulating variables (math functions, mainly)
- serial output, delay()
- test program on an actualy board to show that serial output works (hello world program)

Electronics primer
- electricity is expressed as going from positive to negative
- volts and amps (pressure and volume)
- what a short is, and why it is bad (high amps burn out stuff)
- what high and low mean (5v and 0v)
- the fact that a disconnected pin may give random input
- pull-down resistor to force low
- switch connected to Vcc, gives clear high and low as input


Board basics
- pinMode setup
- manipulating the pin output with digitalWrite()
- using variables to make the pin alternate every second
- set up circuit with LED and button (with pull down resistor)
- LED flashes only while button is held down
